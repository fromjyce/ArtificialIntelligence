# Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various Artificial Intelligence algorithms, grouped into two key areas: **Gaming Algorithms** and **Search Algorithms**. These assignments are part of my fifth semester coursework..

### Project Directories

1. **GamingAlgorithms**:
   - Implements classic gaming algorithms like **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
   - These algorithms are widely used in two-player games to optimize decision-making.

2. **SearchAlgorithms**:
   - Includes 12 fundamental AI search algorithms such as **A Star Search**, **Breadth-First Search**, **Beam Search**, and more.
   - These algorithms are essential for solving optimization and pathfinding problems.

## Running the Project

The programs have been tested on the Visual Studio Code IDE in Windows 11. You are free to choose any IDE that suits your needs.
